(This project is still in development. There might be some bugs in the code and some features might change over time.)  

This fork implements online multiplayer to KleleAtoms thru UDP using ENet.  

## Features
- Play KleleAtoms with your buddies (up to 4 players)
- Avatar system
- Player lobby (waiting room)

## Planned Features
- Chat system
- Admin tools
- Vote system
- Dedicated server mode

## Aditional notes
In order to host a server, you need to have a public ip and an open UDP port on your router (default 5047).  

To add your own avatar, you must add a 64x64 png image called `avatar.png` to the app data directory.  
On Windows it should be in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\LOVE\kleleatoms`  
On Linux it should be in `~/.local/share/love/kleleatoms`
